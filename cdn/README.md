# file-cdn

This's a file cdn stuff based on `express.js` (and some HTML + CSS Stuff) to make a cdn server for (un)necessary thing to my old PC server (which is I called it sub NAS Service).

### Installation

For the installation

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/dethMastery/file-cdn.git
cd ./file-cdn
yarn
```

or use `npm` or `pnpm` to install the package. :D

### Usage

This project is based on `express.js` which use node.js as engine. So everything you need to do is just run the below command.

```zsh
yarn start
```

And like the above. It's okay to use `npm` or `pnpm`.

### Too lazy?

Are you too lazy to set-up everything? For my recommend to use DockerFile from [katsuDocker](https://github.com/katsuDocker/file-uploader-dockerize) to setup `uploader`, `cdn` and `listing` :D
