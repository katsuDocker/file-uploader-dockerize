# file-uploader (Docker Edition)

This Repository is made by the same creator from [dethMastery/file-uploader](https://github.com/dethMastery/file-uploader) for using in Docker and for anyone too lazy to write their own one :3

This docker compose is build from the repository and [9001/copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) to setting up this compose :D

## Usage

### At first!

Don't forget to set up copyparty config in [cdn folder](./cdn) (I left my sample there :3). If you want to setup more just go and see the project page

- [copyparty example 1](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/docs/example.conf)
- [copyparty example 2](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/docs/example2.conf)
- [copyparty Docs](https://github.com/9001/copyparty?tab=readme-ov-file#server-config)

After setup copyparty config. Don't forget to update the `ENV` in [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) before run the compose
